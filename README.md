## **PolyMC-Offline**

PolyMC is a custom launcher for Minecraft that focuses on predictability, long term stability and simplicity.

This is a **fork** of the PolyMC Launcher and is not endorsed by PolyMC. 
This **fork** simply remove's DRM (Microsoft) and was made because of Microsofts recent actions.


# Installation

Only way to currently install this **fork** is simply to build it yourself.


## Building
